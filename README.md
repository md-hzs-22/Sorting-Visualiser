# Sorting-Visualiser

## Overview

Sorting Visualizer is a web app that shows how the different sorting algorithms work.It helps you see and understand how these algorithms sort a list of numbers by showing each step of the process in real-time. 

## Features

- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms**: Visualize popular sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort and Insertion Sort.
- **Step-by-Step Visualization**: Watch how elements are compared, swapped, and moved in real-time.
- **Adjustable Speed**: Control the speed of the visualization to slow down or speed up the animation.
- **Adjustable Array Size**: Manually adjust the size of the array and shuffle elements to see different scenarios.
- **Interactive Interface** 

## Usage
Once the webpage is opened, you'll be greeted with an interface to start visualizing sorting algorithms. Here's how you can use the Sorting Visualizer:

#### Step-by-Step Guide

1. Select a Sorting Algorithm: Choose from the list of available sorting algorithms.
2. Adjust Array Size: Use the slider to set the number of elements in the array. 
3. Shuffle Array: Click the 'New Array' button to randomize the array elements.
4. Start Visualization: Click any sorting algorithm button like 'Bubble Sort' or 'Insertion Sort' to begin the sorting visualization.
5. Control Speed: Adjust the slider to change the speed of the animation.
6. Pause in between: This feature allows you stop the animation in between. The pause button will change into 'Resume' on clicking, hence clicking 'Resume' will continue the animation.
